My Github account is for my CTI class labs. 
This repository will hold all of my future assignments in it.

# About me
I am an extro-introverted person; meaning I'm more of an extroverted person, but I have my moments where I would like to be a homebody with nobody bothering me. I am an adventurous person, I like workout on my spare time, play sports, videogames and even travel. I am a Personal Trainer at Burn Boot Camp, I enjoy working on cars and cooking.
## My Interest 
For academics, I am interested in Informations Technology (Cloud Infrastructure) and being a psychologist. 
## Websites I Recommend
  - [BPM Finder] (https://bpmfinder.net/) - I find BPM finder extremely useful for DJs and producers as it allows you to find the speed and key of the beat for editing purposes.
  - [CarCareKiosk] (https://www.carcarekiosk.com/) - I would recommend CarCareKiosk to any future mechanic or anyone interested in working on their own cars. This website allows you to search the make and model of your car, find the part you are looking for, tells you what tools you will need, all while giving you a step-by-step installation/replacement process via video for the job.
